# Lyzard

Lyzard is a code editor that helps beginner programmers visualize what their code is doing and by displaying the current state of the variables in a panel and highlighting how each line of code changes the state of the variables. Lyzard works for single values and lists, but does not support all of python's language features. It also helps in the understanding of algorithms and debugging simple code.

Run index.py to start Lyzard or start Lyzard from one of the nightly binaries if python is not available. The binaries are packaged with PyInstaller.

Help on how to use Lyzard can be found in help.png. Example python programs that work with Lyzard are put in the demos folder.
